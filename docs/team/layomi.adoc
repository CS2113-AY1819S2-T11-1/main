== PROJECT: Efficient Learning Scheduler

---

== Overview

This is a desktop Efficient Learning Scheduler application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application targeting NUS School of Computing students who are interested to learn how to learn. Our efficient learning scheduler implements ALSETâ€™s proven learning strategy such as spacing. We believe that with our application at your expense, you will be able to develop a good and efficient learning habit that will help you achieve your academic or career goals.
== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add an activity to a Person's timetable*
** What it does: adds an activity to a Person's timeTable.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to be able to add an activity to the timeTable.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a getStringTimeTable method that changes the timeTable to a 2D array of Strings.
