== Overview

Efficient Learning Scheduler is a scheduler app for students to efficiently learn modules they desire to take

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the addModule command to the program
** What it does: allows the users to add modules they desire
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: sort the moduleList by alphabet sequence
