== Introduction

Efficient Learning Scheduler is targeted to NUS students who are interested in finding ways to improve the efficiency of their learning habits. It generates an efficient and tailored learning schedule for these students to follow daily. The generated learning schedule takes into account the modules that the students are taking this semester to make their learning as efficient as possible. This intelligent scheduler also takes in research data from ALSET (http://nus.edu.sg/alset/) to complement the schedule based on past data from other students who took the modules.
== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Views all the possible commands to be used on the program. +
Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `add`

Adds a new module into the scheduler database.
Format: add m/MODULE_CODE c/CREDITS t/DAY,TIMESTART-TIMEEND
Example: add m/CS2113 c/4 t/Wednesday,12-14 t/Tuesday,11-12

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)


=== Adding an event to the event calendar : `addevent`
Adds an event to the event calendar.
Format: addevent ett/TITLE ed/DATE etm/TIME ev/VENUE \[eta/AUDIENCE] \[edc/DRESSCODE] \[eds/DESCRIPTION]

[TIP]
Target audience, dress code and description are not compulsory. Event can still be added to the calendar without these attributes.

Examples:
* addevent ett/UBS - Unlock Your Potential with us ed/01/04/2019 etm/15:00-16:00 ev/UBS Office eta/All Year 1 female students edc/Business Formal eds/Unlock Your Potential with us.
* addevent ett/Career Festival ed/05/06/2019 etm/10:00-12:00 ev/MPSH

=== Listing all events : `listevent`
Shows a list of all events in the event calendar and show it in the left pane of the application.
Format: listevent

=== Generating a learning schedule: 'interleave' `[coming in v2.0]`

Generates a learning schedule based on the modules in the storage. A calendar week view will appear in the GUI as seen above in Section 2.
User would be able to generate a timetable based on the concept of interleaving.
During one of my interactions with Mr Fung from ALSET, he mentioned that students should study in settings that closely resembles exam settings.
That was what inspired this project and feature.
Thus, the default (and minimum) focus period is 30 mins (average human attention span) with 5 mins rest and maximum is 2 hours with 2 hours rest,
as most exams lasts 2 hours and occurring from either 9am-11am, 1pm-3pm and 5pm-7pm.
Format: interleave

====  Generate a interleaved schedule based on module codes `[coming in v?.?]`

Interleave each module with 30 mins blocks. Assume each module has 3 hours self study.

====  Include breaks between focus periods. `[coming in v?.?]`

====  Allow 30 mins <= focus period value <= 2 hours. `[coming in v?.?]`

====  Input module workloads for interleaving. `[coming in v?.?]`

====  Input module codes and timetable automatically interleaved from data from CORs. `[coming in v?.?]`

====  Sign in with student ID and timetable automatically interleaved from data from CORs `[coming in v?.?]`

====  Use the app to collect data anonymously on students users. `[coming in v?.?]`

Extract academic performance indicators anonymously from school database, then convert all these data into an analysable format for data analysis, trend finding etc.

====  Implement something to help students extend their focus period to maximum setting.  `[coming in v?.?]`

==== Viewing learning schedule for a specific day: `dayview` `[coming in v2.0]`

Switches the calendar view from week view to day view on a specific date. Can only be done after generate is called.
Format: dayview DD/MM/YYYY
Example: dayview 11/02/2019


==== Listing all schedule for a specific day: `daylist` `[coming in v2.0]`
Lists down all tasks for one particular day in a list format (and not calendar view).
Can only be done after generate is called.Format: daylist DD/MM/YYYY
Example: daylist 11/02/2019

==== Clearing all schedule: 'clear' `[coming in v2.0]`

Clears the learning schedule and deletes all existing modules in the database.
Format: clear

==== Undoing previous command: 'undo' `[coming in v2.0]`
Restores the learning schedule to the state before the previous undoable command was executed.
Format: undo

==== Redoing previous command: 'redo' `[coming in v2.0]`
Reverses the most recent undo command.
Format: redo

==== adding an activity to a persons Timetable: 'addActivity' `[coming in v2.0]`

adds an activity to a persons time table.
Format: addActivity

==== Exiting the program: 'exit'
Exits the Efficient Learning Scheduler.
Format: exit

=== Compare two time table: 'tablecompare' `[coming in v2.0]`
compare two time table to find the difference
Format:tablecompare

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

==== Clearing all entries : `clear` `[coming in v2.0]`

Clears all entries from the address book. +
